This is the final project for CS496: Cloud and Mobile Computing.

It is a Windows 10 Universal Application that allows users to create account and create, edit and delete restaurant reviews.

The backend is hosted in the cloud using Azure.  The account and review data is stored in the non-relational Azure Tables and is accessed via a RESTFUL-like API coded in C#.

The front end is a Windows 10 Universal Application, coded in HTML, Javascript and WinJS, that allows users to create accounts, log-in, create, edit and delete reviews.
The application utilizes the device's geolocation to query Google Maps API to determine the address for the review.

For more detailed information regarding the API and a video demonstration, see the FinalProject.pdf

This is a desktop application that aids in the reconciliation and record keeping for sending loan images to a third-party for bookmarking.

Written the C#, the application interacts with a SQL database, using stored procedures, to store the original loan image information (file name, loan number, page count, date uploaded) and the similar bookmarked information.  The application reconciles the two versions of the file to ensure the same file name, loan number and page count for each PDF.

Before this application, the File Management team had to store Page Count excel files and preform manual VLookups to perform the reconciliation.  Additionally, the Finance department had to combine dozens of Page Count excel files to reconcile with the third-party billing reports every month.  Once the company reaches their goal of >90% of files sent for bookmarking, this application will save atleast an hour per day of work.
